## üìÑ Overview

This project is part of an open-source initiative to develop smart home hardware using the ESP32 and KiCAD 9.0. The board can be used for controlling lights, sensors, and other appliances over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The tutorial covers:

- Creating schematics with proper component symbols and wiring
- Designing a double-layer PCB using KiCAD
- Exporting production-ready Gerber files
- Assembling and soldering the board
- (Optional) Uploading firmware using PlatformIO or Arduino IDE

This project is suitable for makers, students, and electronics enthusiasts looking to learn PCB design and IoT development.
